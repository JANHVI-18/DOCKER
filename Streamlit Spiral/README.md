# 🌈✨ Streamlit Spiral Visualization App with Docker


![Dashboard Preview](https://github.com/JANHVI-18/Project-Streamlit_Dashboard/blob/main/Streamlit_dashboard%20(2).png)

🌟 Welcome to the **Streamlit Spiral Visualization App**! This project demonstrates a simple and interactive Python application built with Streamlit to visualize a spiral. You can customize the spiral’s characteristics using adjustable sliders and view the changes in real-time. The app is Dockerized for easy deployment and consistency across environments.

---

## 🌟🔥 Features

- 🎛️ **Interactive Controls**: Use sliders to adjust the number of points and turns in the spiral.
- 📊 **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch the spiral change dynamically in response to slider adjustments.
- 🐳 **Dockerized Application**: The app is packaged within a Docker container, ensuring portability and easy deployment.

---

## 🚀💻 Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python 3**: The core programming language for this app.
- 📈 **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive and beautiful web applications.
- 📊 **Altair**: A declarative statistical visualization library for Python used for rendering the spiral.
- 🐳 **Docker**: Containerizes the app for consistent behavior across different environments.
- 📑 **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and handling data frames.
- 🔢 **Numpy**: Provides efficient numerical computations for data processing.

---

## ⚙️📋 Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- 🐳 **Docker**: To build and run the app inside a container.
- 🌲 **Git**: To clone the repository.

If you don't have Docker installed, follow the instructions in the [Official Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

---

## 🛠️📂 Getting Started

### Step 1: 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/JANHVI-18/DOCKER
 cd Docker_Practices
```

### Step 2: 📝 Create a `requirements.txt` File

Ensure the project directory includes a `requirements.txt` file containing the necessary dependencies:

```
streamlit
altair
pandas
numpy
```

### Step 3: 🐳 Build the Docker Image

```bash
 docker build -t streamlit .
```

This will use the `Dockerfile` to build the image named `streamlit`.

#### 📌 Check If the Image is Built

After building the image, you can check if it has been created by either:

- 🖥️ Using Docker Desktop: Go to the **Images** section to verify if the `streamlit` image is listed.
- 💻 Using the Command Line: Run the following command to list all Docker images:

```bash
 docker images
```

---

### Step 4: 🚀 Run the Docker Container

```bash
 docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit
```

This command will map port 8501 inside the container to port 8501 on your local machine.

### Step 5: 🌐 Access the Streamlit App

After running the container, open your browser and go to:

```
 http://localhost:8501
```

The Streamlit app should now be visible, allowing you to interactively adjust the spiral’s number of points and turns.

## 🌀✨ How the App Works

### 🎚️ Sliders for Customization
- 🔢 **Number of points in spiral**: Controls the number of points that form the spiral.
- 🔄 **Number of turns in spiral**: Adjusts how many full turns the spiral makes.

### 🔥 Real-Time Visualization
As you adjust the sliders, the spiral is dynamically updated in real-time.

### 🧩 Under the Hood
- 📐 The app generates the spiral points based on polar coordinates.
- ✍️ The `x` and `y` positions are calculated using mathematical functions, and the results are rendered using Altair charts in the Streamlit app.

## 💡 Code Explanation

- 📦 **NamedTuple for Points**: The spiral points are stored as `Point` objects (with `x` and `y` coordinates) using Python’s namedtuple.
- 🔄 **Generating Spiral Data**: The total number of points and turns are used to calculate the spiral coordinates. The angle for each point is derived using the polar coordinate system.
- 📊 **Streamlit Visualization**: The data is passed to Altair for visualization, and the spiral is displayed as a scatter plot, with each point represented as a circle.

---

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are a few tips:

- 📜 **Check Docker Logs**: If the container fails to start, use the following command to check the logs:

```bash
 docker logs <container_id>
```

- 📦 **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**: If there are errors related to missing packages, make sure the `requirements.txt` is correctly copied into the Docker image, and the `pip install` command runs successfully during the Docker build.
